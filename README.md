# KmeansTensorFlow
- *K*-means clustering;
- Unsupervised learning problem;
- Unlabelled data;
- Code is run on CPU, but implemented with respect to GPU;
- Code is based on the [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai) MOOC: 
    - performed on randomly generated data;
    - unlabelled data;
    - some comprehensive description added for educational purposes;
    - methods are extracted from original module file with OOP code for visalisation purposes; 
    - original file with OOP code is attached.

#### Determining the number of clusters in a data set (see 2_N_Clusters.ipynb)
- The elbow method of finding value for *k*;
- Scikit-learn;
- SciPy;
- Code is based on the [kmeans elbow method](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/kmeans-elbow-method/) tutorial.
