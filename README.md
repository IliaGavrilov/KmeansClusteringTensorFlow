# KmeansTensorFlow
- *K*-means clustering;
- Unsupervised learning problem;
- Unlabelled data;
- Code is run on CPU, but implemented with respect to GPU;
- Basic naive algorithm(?);
- Speeding up mean-shift clustering using approximate nearest neighbors(?);
- Code is based on the [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai) MOOC: 
    - performed on randomly generated data;
    - unlabelled data;
    - some comprehensive description added for educational purposes.
